# Wordle Winner

The goal is to write a program that solves wordle in fewer tries than the top ranked city (Canberra, Australia) solving average of [3.57 guesses](https://word.tips/wordle-wizards/).

Future updates could include writing a NN that solves wordle and writing a script that pulls the solution for the day's wordle from the NYT and tries to solve it locally.

The rules of wordle:
* 6 guesses per word
* On each guess you are informed which letters you guessed are in the word and if they are in the right spot or not
