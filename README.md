# Wordle Winner

The goal is to write a program that solves wordle in fewer tries than the top ranked city (Canberra, Australia) solving average of (3.57 guesses)[https://word.tips/wordle-wizards/].

Future updates could include writing a NN that solves wordle and writing a script that pulls the solution for the day's wordle from the NYT and tries to solve it locally.
